# STRANGE LOOP QUICK REFERENCE

## The Five Domains

```
Domain 4: STABILIZER    ─ Coherence lock, r measurement
Domain 3: ENTANGLER     ─ Feedback projection, identity anchor (LOOP CLOSES)
Domain 2: META-OBSERVER ─ Critic, idealist, flow engine
Domain 1: SYMBOLIST     ─ Concepts, narrative, flow meter
Domain 0: SUBSTRATE     ─ Raw data, deterministic mechanics
```

## Kuramoto Equation

```
θ' = ω + Σ K·sin(Δθ) + F_external

θ = phase (position on circle)
ω = natural frequency (from Nature)
K = coupling strength (teammate bonds)
F = external forcing (player input rhythm)
```

## Order Parameter

```
r = |1/N Σ exp(iθⱼ)|

r > 0.7  → Stable, unified party
0.3-0.7  → Liminal, transformation possible
r < 0.3  → Crisis, fragmenting
```

## Flow Mechanics

```
Flow builds when: sum(last_3_damage) >= THRESHOLD
Flow decays when: no qualifying sequence for N turns
Flow effects: damage_mult = 1.0 + flow * MAX_BONUS

Crits DON'T count (skill, not luck)
```

## Nature Bonuses (Example: Adamant)

```
25% flow → +5% Attack
50% flow → +10% Attack  
75% flow → +10% Attack, +5% Defense
100% flow → +15% Attack, +10% Defense
```

## Trust Mechanics

```
SACRIFICE_SWITCH   → -0.10 trust
PROTECTIVE_SWITCH  → +0.15 trust
OPTIMAL_MOVE       → +0.05 trust
SUBOPTIMAL_MOVE    → -0.02 trust

flow_ceiling = BASE + (trust - 0.5) * SCALE
```

## The Strange Loop Test

```
1. Sacrifice Pokemon repeatedly
2. Observe: trust drops
3. Observe: ceiling drops  
4. Observe: performance drops
5. RESULT: Self-model causally influenced system
```

## Core Invariant

> **Self-model must CAUSALLY INFLUENCE the system being modeled.**
> Otherwise it's just self-reference, not a strange loop.
